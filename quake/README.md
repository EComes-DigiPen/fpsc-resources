# The Quake Folder
There isn't much in here currently, but here's some info on what you'll find here.

* [The Quake Resources List](Quake-Resources.md)  
    A mildly long list of a bunch of links to various Quake-related things.
* [Pre-Configured Quakespasm-Spiked Package](quakespasm_spiked_win64.7z)  
    A pre-configured version of Quakespasm-Spiked 2022-August-11 for 64-bit Windows. Intended for those who just want to play Quake without fiddling with the config files. Shareware game data is included.
* [Quake 1 Shareware](quake1_shareware_pak0.7z)  
    The Quake 1 shareware game data file. Requires 7-Zip to extract the .pak file from the compressed archive. Create a folder named "id1" next to your source port's executable, and place the .pak file in there. Highly compressed from 18.7 MB down to 5.8 MB for a slightly faster and considerably smaller download.
* [Quake III Arena Demo Installer](Q3ADemo.7z)  
    A 7-Zip archive of the official Quake III Area demo installer. I tried to compress it, but 7-Zip only managed to shave 284 KB off of the uncompressed 48.9 MB.
