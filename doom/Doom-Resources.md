## Source Ports:

### Singleplayer-Focused:
* [Chocolate Doom](http://chocolate-doom.org)  
    A strictly vanilla Doom source port for non-DOS operating systems.
* [Crispy Doom](http://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom)  
    A fork of Chocolate with extra features, including widescreen and the removal of vanilla engine limitations. If a mod is noted as requiring a limit-removing port, Crispy will do the job.
* [Woof!](http://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof)  
    A descendant of Boom and MBF by the author of Crispy. Plenty of configuration options, and compatible with PWADs that require Boom or MBF features.
* [PrBoom+](http://prboom-plus.sourceforge.io)  
    A descendant of Boom and MBF currently maintained by the lead developer of GZDoom. It is nearly identical to Woof in its feature set and PWAD compatibility. Unlike Woof, it supports OpenGL rendering.
* [GZDoom](http://zdoom.org)  
    Although it has awful default settings out of the box and requires configuration to get it to behave more like vanilla Doom, it is compatible with almost every Doom mod out there. If a mod is in PK3 format, it likely can only be played in GZDoom.

### Multiplayer-Focused:
* [Zandronum](http://zandronum.com)  
    A descendant of ZDoom with support for various multiplayer gamemodes such as co-op, deathmatch, team deathmatch, and capture the flag.
* [Q-Zandronum](http://qzandronum.com)  
    Made specifically for the [Quake Champions: Doom Edition](http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Quake_Champions:_Doom_Edition) mod, this fork of Zandronum adds various new features such as optional Quake-style movement, improved netcode, and other quality-of-life features.
* [Odamex](http://odamex.net)  
    Another descendant of ZDoom geared towards multiplayer.

## Tools:

### Map Editors:
* [Ultimate Doom Builder](http://github.com/jewalky/UltimateDoomBuilder)  
    An advanced map editor. Ideal for creating maps that take advantage of advanced features offered by ZDoom-descendant ports, but it can be used to create maps compatible with Boom and vanilla source ports.
* [Doom Builder X](http://github.com/anotak/doombuilderx)  
    An advanced map editor, very similar to UDB since it also descends from Doom Builder 2.
* [Eureka Editor](http://eureka-editor.sourceforge.net)  
    A rather basic graphical map editor, ideal for creating maps for Boom and vanilla source ports.

### WAD Tools:
* [SLADE](http://slade.mancubus.net)  
    The swiss army knife of Doom modding, SLADE is essential for creating any kind of PWAD. Includes a map editor, patch/texture editor, graphics converter and palletizer, and many more.
* [DeuTex](http://github.com/Doom-Utils/deutex)  
    An advanced command-line utility to create and unpack WAD files. Ideal for use in automating the compilation of loose assets into a single PWAD.

### DeHackEd Tools:
* [WhackEd4](http://teamhellspawn.com/exl/whacked4)  
    The best graphical DeHackEd patch editor there is. Supports DeHackEd formats used by vanilla, Boom, and MBF.
* [DEH 9000](http://github.com/fragglet/deh9000)  
    An advanced Python API for creating DeHackEd patches.

### Launchers:
* [ZDL](http://github.com/lcferrum/qzdl)  
    A graphical mod launcher.
* [Doomseeker](http://doomseeker.drdteam.org)  
    A server browser for source ports that support multiplayer, although is primarily meant for Zandronum. Chocolate and Crispy are supported.

## Websites:
* [idGames Archive](http://doomworld.com/idgames)  
    A massive repository of Doom WADs, ports, and tools collected throughout the nearly three decades since Doom's release.
* [Doomworld](http://doomworld.com)  
    A forum site for everything classic Doom. Known for hosting a mirror of the [idGames archive](http://doomworld.com/idgames) as well as hosting the annual [Cacowards](http://doomworld.com/cacowards) event for noteworthy Doom mods released that year.
* [Doom Wiki](http://doomwiki.org)  
    A wiki for everything about classic Doom. Whether you're wondering about engine technical specifications, lore, other Doom engine games, notable mods, or prominent community members, this wiki is almost guaranteed to have a page for it.
* [WAD Archive](http://wad-archive.com)  
    Another website that has a massive amount of Doom WADs. Not as organized as the idGames Archive.
