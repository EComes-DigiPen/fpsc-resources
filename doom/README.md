# The Doom Folder
There isn't much in here currently, but here's some info on what you'll find here.

* [The Doom Resources List](Doom-Resources.md)  
    A mildly long list of a bunch of links to various Doom-related things.
* [Pre-Configured Crispy Doom Package](fpsc-crispy-doom-5.12.0-win64.7z)  
    A pre-configured version of Crispy Doom 5.12.0 for 64-bit Windows. Intended for those who just want to play Doom without fiddling with the included config tool or config files.
* [Free IWAD Package](iwads.7z)  
    A 7-Zip archive of the Doom Shareware IWAD as well as the latest official FreeDoom and FreeDM releases.
* [DOOMWADDIR Environment Variable Helper Script](DOOMWADDIR.bat)  
    A small batch script that sets the DOOMWADDIR variable. This environment variable is used by source ports to locate where your IWAD files are.
